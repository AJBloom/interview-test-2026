# NOTE: Discussion — Project Loom virtual threads (Spring Boot 3.2+).
# Replaces the Tomcat request thread pool AND @Async executor with virtual threads.
# Virtual threads are ~1 KB vs ~1 MB for platform threads, so thousands can block
# on I/O simultaneously without exhausting the thread pool.
# No code changes required — existing blocking code "just works".
# See VirtualThreadConfig.kt for the manual equivalent and the coroutine comparison.
